# langchain-runnables
Run anything, anywhere — with LangChain Runnables.

This repository explores LangChain Runnables, a core abstraction in LangChain that provides a standard way to define, compose, and execute AI workflows. Instead of thinking in terms of isolated functions, Runnables let you build modular pipelines that can chain together models, prompts, tools, retrievers, and more.

# 🌟 What Are Runnables?

A Runnable is a building block in LangChain that represents something that can be executed.

Think of it as a lego piece for AI workflows.

It could be a prompt, an LLM call, a retriever, or even a custom function.

Runnables can be composed together — like Prompt → Model → OutputParser.

# ✨ Why Use Runnables?

🔗 Composable → Chain multiple steps together with simple operators.

⚡ Streamlined Execution → Handle inputs and outputs consistently.

🔄 Reusable → Build once, reuse in multiple pipelines.

🛠 Extensible → Wrap your own logic as a Runnable.
